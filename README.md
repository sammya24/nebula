Thanks for taking the time to check out my project! This is a design-heavy project where users can learn more about astrology and discover their astrological signs. Page is fully responsive at different screen sizes.

# notes for grader
- the header is sticky and not fixed intentionally as a stylistic choice
- hovering over some images makes them wiggle
- try clicking on the down arrow at the top of the page
- clicking on 'current phases' brings up my api data -- the moon images are from the api so they don't quite fit with my theme
- try entering your birthday, this will persist between page reloads
