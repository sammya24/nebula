thanks for taking the time to check out my project!

check it out here: https://wustl-cse204a-sp2024-2.github.io/final-project-sammya24/

notes for grader:

- just fyi, the header is sticky and not fixed intentionally as a stylistic choice
- hovering over some images makes them wiggle
- try clicking on the down arrow at the top of the page
- clicking on 'current phases' brings up my api data -- the moon images are from the api so they don't quite fit with my theme
- try entering your birthday, this will persist between page reloads
